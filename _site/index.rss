		<title>Introduction</title>
		<description><![CDATA[
			<p>Welcome to RobWeychert.com V7! There are a number of new things I want to try with my site, from structure to aesthetics to code, and so it’s time to begin a fresh redesign. Inspired by my friends <a href="https://2020.destroytoday.com/">Jonnie</a> and <a href="https://redesign.frankchimero.com/">Frank</a>, I’ve decided to do it in public from the ground up. I’m starting with bare-bones HTML and as the design process unfolds, each step will be reflected on the site in real time and documented with a succinct blog post. I’m hoping to post at least once a week, but that will probably fluctuate.</p>

		<p>Here are some of the core ideas driving the redesign, which I’ll flesh out further in subsequent posts:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> The blog on the current version of my site, V6, <a href="https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/">collects</a> most of what I’ve written for public consumption since 2001 across nearly 40 different sources. I’d like to expand that to include even more sources and content types, collecting virtually everything I’ve shared online in one sprawling, sortable/filterable timeline.</li>
			<li><strong>Projects:</strong> I’ve made a lot of cool things personally and professionally over the past few years, announced their launches, and written about why and how they were made, but I still need an easily browsable place to collect and share that work.</li>
			<li><strong>Overprint:</strong> The basis of the aesthetic I want to explore.</li>
			<li><strong>Tools and tech:</strong> My approach to layout and style is evolving with the help of expanding browser support for CSS specs like Flexbox, Grid, and Custom Properties. I’m also considering moving away from Jekyll to another static site generator as well as updating my deployment method from FTP sync to something more modern.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>More to come. Stay tuned!</p>

It may be the first in the series (other than the original) to have a director and screenwriters with name recognition, but this is just another <cite>Halloween</cite> sequel, thankfully nothing less but certainly nothing more. Itâ€™s pretty boring.

Also, is there any greater talent in Hollywood who is as routinely wasted as Judy Greer is?

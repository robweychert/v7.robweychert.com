The director of <cite>The Raid</cite> putting his spin on <cite>The Wicker Man</cite> sure sounds like fun, and <cite>Apostle</cite> starts off with promise, with a wild-eyed Dan Stevens lurching around a muddy village of Victorian cultists. But the movie kneecaps itself before the halfway mark, rushing to resolve the most interesting aspects of its plot in favor of making a gonzo, gore-soaked spectacle of the superfluous remainder.

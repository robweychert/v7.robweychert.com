The film I was most looking forward to seeing at Ottawa 2018, and it did not disappoint, despite a frustrating audio sync issue at the screening. Exquisite craft, from its empathic felted puppets to its gorgeous cinematography. Confident surrealism without a hint of self-consciousness, which may defy rational understanding but is nevertheless entirely engrossing. I need to learn more about French colonialism.

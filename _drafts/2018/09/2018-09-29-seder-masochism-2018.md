The story of Passover and the Exodus as a jukebox musical through a feminist lens, recontextualizing familiar songs to interrogate the violence and subjugation wrought by the patriarchal leadership of the world’s dominant religions. It’s not as heavy as it sounds, but wow is it smart, inventive, and extremely entertaining.

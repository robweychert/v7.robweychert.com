Fairly standard coming-of-age story, based on a graphic novel. Author seems to portray herself as supremely level-headed. Pretty detailed, somewhat at the expense of an arc. Could have been shorter? Leans hard on sisterhood, all-female family, patriarch in absentia. Didn’t resonate with me like many coming-of-age stories do, maybe because it was so female? Apparently the book focuses a bit more on growing up in cartel culture, and I would’ve liked to see more of that. I wonder if the film eschewed that culturally specific aspect to be more universal and therefore an easier sell in the international market.

A video essay about how [<cite>Star Wars</cite> was saved in the edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFMyMxMYDNk) inspired me to finally watch [Harmy’s Despecialized Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmy%27s_Despecialized_Edition), which had been sitting on my hard drive for years. Not having seen the original practical effects in decades, I expected them to look a lot rougher than they did. Their toyetic artifice is definitely apparent, but knowing how much of a leap forward they were in 1977—the industry drafted behind this achievement for well over a decade—inspires far more awe than the digital revisions that came later.

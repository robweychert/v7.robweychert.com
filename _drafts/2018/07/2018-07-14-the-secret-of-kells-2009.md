The underlying narrative seems sound, but the mythology driving it is vague and the stakes aren’t really made clear. It’s a short movie but I had to watch it in two sittings because I was getting restless. Visually, however, <cite>The Secret of the Kells </cite>is an unparalleled stunner, worthy of its namesake.

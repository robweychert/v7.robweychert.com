I can’t decide if its ideas are muddled or merely complex, but as a pure action movie, <cite>Incredibles 2</cite> is a lot of fun. I’m disappointed that the filmmakers couldn’t find a way to avoid the strobing effects that exclude epileptic viewers. For a company as creatively industrious as Pixar, that struck me as a lazy choice.

As for the preceding short film, <cite>Bao</cite>, bravo to Pixar for stepping away from the Eurocentric boys’ club, but yeesh, maybe apply that diversity to something less cloyingly trite?

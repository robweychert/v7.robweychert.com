Wes Andersonâ€™s films are all effectively stop-motion animation, and part of what I find off-putting about most of his live-action work is the resulting reverse-uncanny-valley effect. I had been over his schtick for years by the time <cite>Fantastic Mr. Fox</cite> came out and made me realize that the world of proper animation is where Anderson belongs. <cite>Isle of Dogs</cite> is a welcome return to that place.

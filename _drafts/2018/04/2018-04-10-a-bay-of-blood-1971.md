This stylish proto-slasher is stupider and trashier than the more highly regarded gothic works of Bavaâ€™s horror ouevre, and more enjoyable for it. <cite>A Bay of Blood</cite> is a must-see for anyone interested in how giallo films paved the way for slashers, especially since <cite>Friday the 13th</cite> borrowed from it liberally.

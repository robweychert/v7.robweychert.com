A technically adroit series of carefully scripted temper tantrums meant to embody the struggle of making capital “A” Art, <cite>Birdman</cite> pays lip service to the nuance that accompanies authenticity, but it tends to make its points as loudly as possible. This is probably about as good as overwrought showbiz navel gazing gets, and it’s still pretty off-putting.

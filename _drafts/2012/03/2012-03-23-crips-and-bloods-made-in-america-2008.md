Going into <cite>Crips and Bloods: Made in America</cite>, I was concerned that it would just be a sensationalist exposé on LA’s two most notorious gangs. But I was pleased to find that it has a genuine curiosity about its subject, which extends beyond the violence and traces the roots of African-American marginalization from the early twentieth century to present day. It is often a bit too stylish for its own good, and I wish it delved deeper into the personal stories of some of its characters, but the interviews it conducts with current and former players do manage to paint a very human portrait of struggle.

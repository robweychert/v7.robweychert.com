You don’t need to know anything about chess to enjoy <cite>Bobby Fischer Against the World,</cite> but you may well want to learn more about the game after you’ve seen the film – if you don’t take it as a cautionary tale.

Bobby Fischer’s story is a true American tragedy, and possibly the twentieth century’s most fascinating example of the tenuous divide between genius and madness, as this film makes abundantly clear. The pacing is a bit uneven, but it lingers in the right spot, making a suspenseful centerpiece of Fischer’s era-defining 1972 world championship match against Boris Spassky. The absence of an interview with Spassky, who declined to participate in the film, is surprisingly inconspicuous, which is a good indicator of the storytelling acumen at work here. The people who were interviewed, who encountered Fischer on and off the chess board, paint a captivating portrait that is as well-formed as it is enigmatic.

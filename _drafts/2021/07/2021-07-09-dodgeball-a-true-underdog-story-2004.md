Next month, my competitive air guitar alter ego will make his national television debut on ESPN 8: The Ocho. Before I absorb the derision of the biggest audience of my “career,” I figured I should see *DodgeBall*, the movie that made it possible, and said movie exceeded my low expectations. Who knows, maybe my compatriots and I can do the same for our audience?

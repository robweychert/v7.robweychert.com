Took a chance on this one knowing nothing about it but Hulu’s description of it (including the cast), which made it sound like a pretty standard late-80s cat-and-mouse serial killer thriller. What I got instead was maybe the most tonally confused movie I have ever seen, something like the product of a neural network trained on *Sea of Love* and *A Fish Called Wanda*. It doesn’t work at all, and I kind of love that about it.

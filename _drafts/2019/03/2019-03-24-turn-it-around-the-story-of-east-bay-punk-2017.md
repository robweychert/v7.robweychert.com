It’s easy to ding this doc for its nearly three-hour run time, which seems self-indulgent. I don’t think its length is one of its strengths, but I didn’t find it to be a slog either. Mostly I just enjoyed hanging out with its characters and hearing their stories, and I was especially tickled to hear members of the apocalyptic Neurosis geeking out over how much they love Green Day. Being something of an outsider who grew up in a countercultural vacuum, the mere fact of the inclusive [924 Gilman](http://www.924gilman.org/) community is incredibly inspiring to me, but learning more about it also gave me valuable perspective on the ethos that helped shape the handful of folks I know who spent time in the scene. Like any good punk thing, <cite>Turn It Around</cite> encouraged me to remember what’s important to me and participate in it.

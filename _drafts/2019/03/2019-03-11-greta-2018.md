Isabelle Huppertâ€™s demented performance is more than this movie deserves and not enough to save it. One might expect the filmmakers to have some fun with this kind of pure pulp, but the whole thing is rote and flat, with plainspoken design and direction and a script that pulls every punch. The closest it comes to generating tension is triggering flashbacks from <cite>The Piano Teacher</cite>, seemingly intentionally. So maybe just watch that instead.

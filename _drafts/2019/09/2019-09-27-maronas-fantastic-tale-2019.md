<cite>Marona’s Fantastic Tale</cite> is a dog’s life story in her own words. Though its namesake’s narration is frequently incisive and eloquent—the dog’s naive perspective on humanity asks some good questions—the film does get a bit treacly here and there. Luckily, any such shortcomings are bulldozed by its endless appetite for graphic invention. Marona’s various humans, the sums of their loves and fears and desires, are defined above all by shape and locomotion, and their forms and movements are only tenuously beholden to physical reality. Seeing animation this effectively expressive at feature length is a rare treat.

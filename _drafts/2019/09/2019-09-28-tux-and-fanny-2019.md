Tux and Fanny cheerfully navigate daily life in a pixelated world: trying to watch multiple TV shows at once, using their cat as a piano, and getting into scrapes with fire ants and magical deer. It’s probably a little longer than it needs to be, I wish its comedic rhythms were a bit more varied, and its Slavic language choice seems to be needlessly calculated to amp up the weirdness for a primarily American audience. But overall it’s a breezy and strangely sweet series of connected vignettes juxtaposing off-kilter jokes with existential musings. In some ways it feels like a slightly more accessible neighbor of Phil Mulloy’s [<cite>Christies</cite> series](https://www.philmulloy.tv/the-christie-trilogy).

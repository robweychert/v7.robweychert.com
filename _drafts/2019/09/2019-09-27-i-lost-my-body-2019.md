I like the idea of a character study focused on hands, and <cite>I Lost My Body</cite> is a frequently compelling execution of the concept. However, its surrealist subplot (a disembodied hand’s epic journey back to its owner) is mostly a distraction, its reliance on various dramatic tropes gets wearisome, and its score pushes way too hard to elicit emotions it hasn’t quite earned. (These <cite>Stranger Things</cite> arpeggiated ’80s synth chords thing are really a thing now, huh?)

Modern fandom is little more than ravenous consumerism, and more than any other Star Wars movie, <cite>The Rise of Skywalker</cite>’s blockbuster maximalism is calibrated with this in mind. When I rewatched <cite>The Force Awakens</cite> and <cite>The Last Jedi</cite> the night before, it felt mostly like homework, and trying to summon anything else to say about <cite>The Rise of Skywalker</cite> feels about the same. Anyway, I’m done. Thanks for the memories, Star Wars, if not this particular one.

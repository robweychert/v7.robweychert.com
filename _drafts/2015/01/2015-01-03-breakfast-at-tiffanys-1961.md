The three things I find most interesting about <cite>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</cite>: 

1. Made in 1961 at the tail end of the Production Code era, it is fascinating to see the film tiptoe around the fact that its two main characters are essentially prostitutes.

2. Even if one forgives its gobsmacking racism, I can’t begin to imagine how Mickey Rooney’s way-over-the-top slapstick could have been deemed fit for inclusion in this or any other film made for adults.

3. The film insists that we sympathize with a man who thought that the best way to take care of a 13-year-old girl who fled her abusive home was to marry her.

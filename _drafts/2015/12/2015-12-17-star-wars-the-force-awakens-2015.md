As I’ve mentioned [before](http://v5.robweychert.com/writing/astro-zombies/), I am wary of the seductive power of nostalgia. The original <cite>Star Wars</cite> trilogy loomed so large in my generation’s childhood that any meaningful attempt to revive it was going to be met with uncritical optimism. So as I cheered along with a packed theater on the opening night of <cite>The Force Awakens</cite>, I remembered that I had done much the same thing sixteen years earlier for <cite>The Phantom Menace</cite>, which, not long after, hindsight revealed to be a pretty poor film. <cite>The Force Awakens</cite> seems less likely to deteriorate on repeat viewings, but its appeal is built almost entirely upon fan service, to the extent that its plot is nearly identical to that of <cite>A New Hope</cite>. As my rating reflects, I won’t deny that I had a ball welcoming back the old cast and seeing its steps retraced by the new one. But tracing only gets you so far. If this new <cite>Star Wars</cite> revival – which is apparently scheduled to continue in perpetuity – is going to be worthwhile, it will need to be less about recreating what was, and more about building something new from it.

As an indictment of our news media’s bloodlust and its complicity in racist fear mongering, the machinations of <cite>Nightcrawler</cite>’s Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Nina Romina (Rene Russo) have the depth and subtlety of a [Chick tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_tract). Their unashamed “if it bleeds, it leads” philosophy is transparently arranged for maximum repugnance*, presumably with the intention of ironically using TV journalism’s own brand of reductive alarmism against it. But the staging of their discussions makes for a stale polemic, too straight-faced for satire and too frank to have any real poignance as social commentary. These peculiar scenes occupy their space awkwardly, their plain statements of <cite>Nightcrawler</cite>’s apparent raison d’être reduced to simple motivation for the sociopathic Bloom, of whom the film is primarily a character study.

* Nina: “We find our viewers are more interested in urban crime creeping into the suburbs. What that means is a victim or victims, preferably well-off and/or white, injured at the hands of the poor, or a minority.”

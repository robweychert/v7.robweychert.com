If you’ve seen Johnny Knoxville’s hilarious Irving Zisman schtick in the <cite>Jackass</cite> movies, you know what to expect from <cite>Bad Grandpa</cite>, and it delivers. But trying to use an actual story to string together its collection of pranks and gags disrupts the pace and dilutes the comedy. The absence of character development was never a problem for the <cite>Jackass</cite> series before, so I’m not sure why they decided to try it here. The closing credits are full of outtakes that would have been a welcome replacement for all the unnecessary exposition.

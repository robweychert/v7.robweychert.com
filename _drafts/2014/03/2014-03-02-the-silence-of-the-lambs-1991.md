No matter how many times I see <cite>The Silence of the Lambs</cite>, it is engrossing from start to finish. Anthony Hopkins’s Hannibal Lecter is unforgettable, but only as a foil for Jodie Foster’s much more sober Clarice Starling, without whom Lecter would be little more than a cartoon. Countless imitators tried and failed to replicate that magic, including <cite>Lambs</cite>’ two sequels. The leads anchor the film, and everything else falls into place around them.

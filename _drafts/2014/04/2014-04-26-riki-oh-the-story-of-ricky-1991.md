As a fan of the sort of slapstick gore found in movies like <cite>Dead Alive</cite> and <cite>Re-Animator</cite>, I had long looked forward to seeing <cite>Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky</cite>. It delivers several gems of cartoon violence, and the over-the-top acting and inept dialogue are frequently funny, but the almost total lack of an actual story makes the scenes between the action too much of a slog.

If <cite>Robo Vampire</cite> has a script, it reads like something a 6-year-old wrote, which makes it a compelling argument for child labor. Somehow this is my first exposure to the hopping vampires of [jiangshi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangshi) folklore, and only the second Godfrey Ho movie I’ve seen. It won’t be the last.

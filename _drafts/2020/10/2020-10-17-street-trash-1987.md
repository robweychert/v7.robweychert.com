Why in the world did it take me so long to see <cite>Street Trash?!</cite> It might be the most grotesque film I’ve ever seen, and its gleeful commitment to thorough vulgarity wouldn’t be a virtue if it weren’t made with such flair. It’s several steps above what I remember of the Troma movies, but doesn’t quite reach the bravura heights of Sam Raimi’s and Peter Jackson’s early splatstick gems. <cite>Street Trash</cite> is apparently also the standard-bearer of the “melt movie” subgenre, several films of which I’ve seen, but whose classification as such was previously unknown to me. Man. What have I been doing with my life.

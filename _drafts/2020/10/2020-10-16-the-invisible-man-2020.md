Neither the trailer nor writer/director Leigh Whannell’s bonafides in the <cite>Saw</cite> and <cite>Insidious</cite> franchises gave me much confidence that this <cite>Invisible Man</cite> remake would be any good, so its overall high quality is a very pleasant surprise indeed. Its loudest moments are its weakest, but thankfully it spends much of its time quietly plumbing the depths of Elisabeth Moss’s crippling PTSD. If there is to be a modern version of the scream queen, may Moss’s nuanced performance here be the template. It’s the best performance I’ve seen all year.

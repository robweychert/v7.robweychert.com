The <cite>Terminator</cite> movies are all basically the same: a bad robot is sent from an apocalyptic future to kill someone who will later be important to humanity’s survival, and a good person or robot is sent to protect that important person. One of the main things that determines a <cite>Terminator</cite> movie’s quality is how much it ties itself in knots to justify the inclusion of an aging Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose titular character is conveniently (if not logically) mass produced. <cite>Dark Fate</cite> isn’t the knottiest <cite>Terminator</cite> movie (that would be <cite>Terminator Genisys</cite>), but the silly plot contrivances it employs in service of Schwarzenegger’s and series matriarch Linda Hamilton’s presence make it a tough sell, especially when neither character brings much to the proceedings beyond empty nostalgia.

But hey, this endeavor is more Michael Bay than Philip K. Dick. If space-time paradoxes and tired one-liners don’t impede your enjoyment of shit getting smashed and blown up, <cite>Dark Fate</cite> has a lot of that, and Mackenzie Davis’s refreshing take on the protector character mostly evens out the moments when the CGI bites off more than it can chew.

How I became so attached to the songs in this movie when it came out the same year I fell in love with thrash metal is anybody’s guess, but “Part of Your World” and “Poor Unfortunate Souls” are the bedrock of my karaoke game. Decades later, no other aspect of <cite>The Little Mermaid</cite> does much for me, although Scuttle is pretty delightful and Ursula is the shit. Can’t believe I only just learned that she was directly inspired by Divine!

The description of this film sounds right up my alley: “A collage contemplation of the contemporary zeitgeist with central attention placed on capitalism and it’s [sic] systems of distribution and the ecological crisis this has wrought.” But its visuals address its subjects in ways that are by turns too obvious and not obvious enough. When people are depicted, they’re either hyper-familiar powerbrokers (Trump, Putin, Zuckerberg) or unidentifiable comic book clippings. Whoever they are, their significance isn’t addressed so much as the mere fact of their existence. Otherwise much of what’s on display is cellophane, prescription drugs, gum wrappers, and other detritus, which I suppose express concern about consumerism and its environmental toll, but it’s too directionless to make any kind of real statement. The whole thing just feels like an unstructured brain dump, and maybe that’s the point, but just because unedited stream-of-consciousness work is a common avant-garde pose doesn’t always make it a valid one.,

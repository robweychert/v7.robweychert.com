After my first screening of OIAF 2020, I was a bit sad about how much of a diminished experience the at-home version of the festival is. Seeing esoteric animated films in a dark theater on a huge screen with an enthusiastic audience is a rare treat I look forward to every year. But my next screening, <cite>Bru & Boegie: The Movie</cite>, seemed tailor-made to demonstrate the benefits of viewing at home. Spoiler alert: 90 of the film’s 94 minutes are effectively a still image of one of the title characters meditating, which I was able to ascertain not by watching the whole thing, but by scrubbing ahead on the timeline after watching the first several minutes of it. I guess this film is an artifact of the juvenile school of thought that values virtually any subversion of expectations. Whether it’s intended as a prank, guerilla mindfulness, or both, its presence on YouTube is one thing, but including it as one of six feature films in competition at a festival? Really?

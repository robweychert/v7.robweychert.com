Alice Lowe was already well into her pregnancy when she was approached to make a film, and she managed to write, direct, and star in <cite>Prevenge</cite> before she gave birth, which is amazing. And there’s a lot to admire about its surrealist fusion of horror, comedy, and drama. But the final product doesn’t quite hang together.

Absent its jaw-dropping stage performances, <cite>Purple Rain</cite> is a weak film. And yet, there is something about the stilted drama of its narrative that elevates those stage performances, giving <cite>Purple Rain</cite> the peculiar distinction of being stronger for the inclusion of its weakest moments. Its otherwise clunky character development is lent a certain cohesiveness when expressed musically. The unconvincing relationships and turmoil established in various poorly-staged, non-musical moments somehow manage to make the already-amazing songs even more amazing (to say nothing of Prince and the Revolution’s incredible showmanship).

It’s therefore unsurprising that Prince’s cinematic followup, <cite>Under the Cherry Moon</cite>, suffers greatly for its absence of musical performances. There are no jaw-dropping moments to make the rest of it worth sitting through, and it solidifies the disappointing reality that Prince’s peerless virtuosity as a musician cast a harsh shadow not only on his limitations as an actor, but also as a writer and director.

And so, especially after the spectacular triumph that is his concert film <cite>Sign o’ the Times</cite>, which follows <cite>Cherry Moon</cite>, there was reason to hope that <cite>Graffiti Bridge</cite>’s veneration of the classic Hollywood musical would make it a worthy sequel to <cite>Purple Rain</cite>. Alas, it is not.

There is plenty of blame to go around: its incoherent Shakespearean spirituality; the smoothed-over urban grit of its soundstages; its paper-thin characters, most of whom are superfluous. But <cite>Graffiti Bridge</cite>’s failure ultimately comes down to the music, whose new jack swing leanings position Prince for the first time as a pop passenger rather than the pop driver. The performances are generally more workmanlike than committed, shot with the hokiest available MTV aesthetics, and several of them – Tevin Campbell’s, George Clinton’s, Mavis Staples’ – have nothing to do with the rest of the movie. It’s not unpleasant, but it’s a far cry from <cite>Purple Rain</cite>’s memorable and singularly earth-shaking statement.

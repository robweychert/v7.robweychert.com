In a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it ambulance scene, an EMT says awkwardly to her charge, “I’m just gonna… check you.” She looks enough like Abbi Jacobson – a Philadelphia area native, like <cite>Split</cite>’s writer/director, M. Night Shyamalan – that it instantly becomes my favorite scene in the movie, a random cameo with Jacobson’s hapless <cite>Broad City</cite> character stumbling into an EMT job for which she is comically unqualified. But it’s not her. In her absence, the scene is reduced to just another tiny vignette of Shyamalan’s frustratingly skewed sense of how real people interact.

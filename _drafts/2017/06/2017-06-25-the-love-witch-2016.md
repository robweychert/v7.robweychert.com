A strange homage/parody of occult and hippie films from the ’60s and ’70s, overloaded with wishy-washy neopaganism and boneheaded musings on heterosexuality and patriarchy. My best guess is that it wants to be some kind of feminist <cite>Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</cite>, but apart from offering an excuse for the wardrobe department to go for broke, I can’t really figure out why this film exists.

Though it does little to distinguish itself from the untold thousands of horror cheapies that litter the streaming landscape, <cite>The Evil Within</cite> has a certain undeniable flair, even if you don’t know it was [the singular obsession of a millionaire meth addict](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/14/the-evil-within-horror-movie-andrew-getty-millionaire-meth) who spent 15 years and vast sums of his own money to make it. “Outsider art” doesn’t quite do it justice. Unlike the bewildering writing of Neil Breen or Tommy Wiseau, writer/director Andrew Getty’s script is the rather pedestrian work of an actual citizen of Earth, but his visual ambitions reach for something like Terry Gilliam territory. The film’s various nightmarish grotesqueries are lovingly labored and occasionally quite memorable.

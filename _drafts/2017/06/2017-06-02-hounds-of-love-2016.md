Plot-wise, <cite>Hounds of Love</cite> is in many ways a fairly by-the-numbers kidnapping / serial killer movie. But after a first act that hews uncomfortably close to crass, skin-crawling exploitation, its character development and attention to style are able to set it apart from less compelling grindhouse fare. Its success in those departments is noteworthy: Emma Booth’s fragile performance has rightly received a lot of praise, and the cinematography and score work well together to create an oppressive atmosphere of dread in broad daylight.

Still, <cite>Hounds of Love</cite> ultimately left me wanting, since its tedious climax – whose cleverest element is lifted directly from <cite>The Silence of the Lambs</cite> – just doesn’t stick the landing, partly because the film’s central maternal themes feel a bit hollow. <cite>Hounds of Love</cite> is about women, and I can’t help but wonder what it would have been with a female director.

Side note: I have no idea why this movie is called <cite>Hounds of Love</cite>, which wouldn’t bother me if it wasn’t already very specifically the name of an ostensibly unrelated Kate Bush song.

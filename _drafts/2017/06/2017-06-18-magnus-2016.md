An interesting profile for the uninitiated, but in its cursory understanding of chess, it makes little effort to understand Magnusâ€™s genius, which remains enigmatic as ever. While Magnus the man has had an outsize role in inspiring a new generation of young chess players, <cite>Magnus</cite> the film fails to depict the game as anything but arcane.

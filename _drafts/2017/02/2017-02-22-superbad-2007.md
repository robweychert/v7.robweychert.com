Apatow productions have a habit of reveling in the pathetic frailty of maleness, and in a way that usually doesnâ€™t do much for me. <cite>Superbad</cite>, the apotheosis of the form, an effortless synthesis of vulgarity and tenderness, is the one that finally reached me. Every time I see it, I laugh until I cry, and then I laugh some more.

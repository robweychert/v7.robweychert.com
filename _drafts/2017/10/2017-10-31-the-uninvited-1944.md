<cite>The Uninvited</cite> is a compelling and well-paced mystery that tries to be a few too many things. The seams between its comedy, melodrama, and horror may be visible, but when it wants to be spooky, it does so very successfully, and the whole thing is beautifully shot. Iâ€™m especially fond of all the opportunities it creates for characters to emerge from and disappear into inky blackness.

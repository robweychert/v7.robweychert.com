Though my feelings on the subject are unambiguous, I have a curious habit of seeking out reminders that I don’t ever want to be a teenage boy again, and <cite>Super Dark Times</cite> is an effective one. Its backwards gaze is largely unvarnished (apart from Ben Frost’s overly atmospheric score), but many moments are richly observed—I could practically smell the dead leaves that decorate those short, aimless hours in late autumn between the school day’s final bell and sunset. The film doesn’t recover from the massive wrong turn it takes in the final act, but it’s nevertheless a promising debut. Bonus points for P.M. Dawn.

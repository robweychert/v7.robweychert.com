Owing to the central relationship between a kindly antiques shop owner and his granddaughter, as well as the enchantingly mysterious mechanical device that upends their lives, <cite>Cronos</cite> feels kind of like a Jean-Pierre Jeunet stab at horror, which I guess could be said of several of Guillermo del Toro’s films. That said, <cite>Cronos</cite>’s imagination and balance of sickly and sweet make for a strong debut. The villains (Claudio Brook and Ron Perlman) aren’t nearly as well-developed as the hero (Federico Luppi), so the stakes never feel all that high, but Luppi is a joy to watch nonetheless.

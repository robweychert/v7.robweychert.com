Once again, death has a nonsensical plan that its victims-to-be generously recite aloud to the viewer in simple declarative sentences as they somehow piece it all together. As with the other <cite>Final Destination</cite> movies, this is recommended for folks who love to see the Mouse Trap board do its thing but are too lazy to set it up.

I admire the chutzpah it takes to acquire a Spanish werewolf/vampire movie, slap a Frankenstein title on it, and sell it in place of (the unwatchable) <cite>Dracula Vs. Frankenstein</cite> you originally promised to American theaters, which is what distributor Sam Sherman did in the early 1970s with <cite>Frankenstein’s Bloody Terror</cite>. The movie is terrible, but at least it introduced me to Paul Naschy, who is apparently Spain’s barrel-chested Boris Karloff.

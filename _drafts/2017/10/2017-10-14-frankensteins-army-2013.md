Mostly an excuse to bring to life a collection of steampunk Nazi monsters that probably began as notebook doodles, and to take advantage of access to some marvelously dilapidated industrial locations. The creatures are fun, but the halfhearted found-footage format is distracting enough to sink the whole thing, flaunting its artifice with English-speaking Russian soldiers and supposed 16mm footage from the 1940s rendered in crisp HD. I know I’m taking this all too seriously, but the film offers no cues to the contrary, and anyway, if suspension of disbelief isn’t a priority, why go the found-footage route? <cite>Frankenstein’s Army</cite> would have worked better as a comic book, haunted house attraction, or <cite>BioShock</cite> DLC.

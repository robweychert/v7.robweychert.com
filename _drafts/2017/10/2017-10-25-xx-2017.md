An anthology of four shorts directed by women, <cite>XX</cite>’s preoccupation with maternal horror is the opposite of the crappy brodown that was <cite>V/H/S</cite>, but it’s ultimately just as disappointing. The shorts are all equally unsatisfying, but Sofia Carrillo’s Švankmajer/Quay-inspired dollhouse-of-horrors interstitials are pretty cool.

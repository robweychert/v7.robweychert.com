If you were like, “We’ve got to see this hybrid <cite>The Thing</cite> / <cite>Terminator</cite> / buddy cop movie from 1987 starring Kyle MacLachlan,” I’d be like, “Um, yes, we certainly do.” And our decision to see it would indeed be a wise one. But as we might have expected, the product is not quite the sum of its parts.

The most engaging slasher films tend to be the ones that continue the whodunit tradition of their giallo forefathers. Not only do you get to enjoy amusing innovations in grisly murder, you get to guess which unlikely suspect is responsible for them. <cite>Happy Birthday to Me</cite> is arguably the best of the whodunits in the first wave of slashers, and its crazy finale is my favorite kind of preposterous.

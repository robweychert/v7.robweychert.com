A serviceable (if blandly presented) documentary with about a zillion variously-credentialed talking heads discussing <cite>Psycho</cite>’s iconic shower scene. The scene’s cultural context and lasting influence are 101 stuff, but <cite>78/52</cite> is at its best when it digs into the minutiae of the storyboards, staging, cinematography, sound design—<cite>casaba!</cite>—editing, symbolism, etc. Even the most dedicated Hitchcock scholar will probably learn something new. The interviews’ steady fawning tone gets a bit grating (only one person acknowledges any flaws in the scene), but this doc is packed with more than enough fascinating factoids to recommend it.

The screening I attended was followed by a Q&A with Janet Leigh’s body double, Marli Renfro, now pushing 80 and thoroughly charming.

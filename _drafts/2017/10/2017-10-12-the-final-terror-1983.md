A subpar backwoods survival slasher with a modest body count and zero mystique. Notable for featuring several cast and crew who would go on to much bigger and better things (Daryl Hannah, Joe Pantoliano), but if Hollywood stars’ humble horror beginnings are the primary draw for you, you’d be better served by <cite>The Burning</cite> (Jason Alexander, Holly Hunter), or, hell, <cite>Friday the 13th</cite> (Kevin Bacon). <cite>The Final Terror</cite> is mostly a snooze.

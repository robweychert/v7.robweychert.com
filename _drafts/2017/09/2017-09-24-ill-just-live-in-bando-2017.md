A middle-aged drama professor faces a choice between a stable teaching career and a chance at his dream of being an actor. As his bad luck piles up, what began as a mild-mannered drama escalates into a complex and rather stressful thriller, without sacrificing much verisimilitude. One of the more interesting takes Iâ€™ve seen on the hell of responsibility.

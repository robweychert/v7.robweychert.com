A young boy tries to find his place in his adopted dysfunctional family. Plenty of subtext about the effects of Westernization and rapid economic development in South Korea in the early 1980s, but this is more about family dynamics amid alcoholism, and its observations feel true, though I wish it did more showing and less telling.

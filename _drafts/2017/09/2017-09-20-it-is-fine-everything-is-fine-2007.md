Steven C. Stewart, a man with severe cerebral palsy, made himself the antihero in a self-penned screenplay for an erotic revenge thriller, and Crispin Glover went pretty far out of his way to commit Stewart’s catharsis to film, co-directing and funding the sexually explicit project with his own money. <cite>It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine</cite> is unforgettable; I commend the effort, and welcome the challenge to broaden the range of unfiltered perspectives we accept from cinema, but the film’s extremely rough edges ultimately prove to be the dominant challenge.

A girl entering adolescence grapples with her emerging queer identity and tries to survive a road trip with her unstable mother. It’s a nice little coming-of-age memoir, but not little enough. I think this would have worked better as a short. The effort spent establishing environs dwarfs the loose plotting and character-building that take place there, and the commitment to non-verbal narrative further limits the film’s ability to tell a personal story. With a few exceptions, its early-’90s pop-cultural signposts don’t reveal much about this particular kid: she was disgusted by the idea of becoming a woman, yes, but we see more of her watching the same TV shows, listening to the same music, and playing the same Gameboy as her peers. She goes past relatable and becomes almost generic.

Regardless of my quibbles, I applaud Peterson’s efforts, and hope the overlap between animation and queer cinema continues to grow.

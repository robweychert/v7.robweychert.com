When I see a new film of almost universal acclaim, sometimes I go out of my way to read the negative reviews to get a little distance from the zeitgeist. In the case of <cite>The Florida Project</cite>’s [negative reviews](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-florida-project/reviews/by/entry-rating-lowest/), I saw a few patterns:

• the expected backlash against the critical consensus, • the frustration of viewers who prefer more traditional narratives, • locals objecting to the portrayal of Florida, • accusations of poverty porn

One flavor of that last pattern argues that <cite>The Florida Project</cite> is insufficiently critical of the struggling people it portrays. Indie cinema tends not to attract proponents of callous conservatism, so it’s a surprising opinion, and one that says more about the viewer than the film.

Other poverty porn arguments are more vague, but I guess the idea is either that <cite>The Florida Project</cite>’s darker moments cynically elicit sympathy via maudlin class warfare clichés, or that its lighter moments somehow trivialize the plight of the poor.

I’m with the zeitgeist on this one. <cite>The Florida Project</cite> encapsulates the beauty of childhood and the weight of poverty, and offers a unique, funny, devastating, visually stunning window into how they coexist. I wasn’t crazy about the ending, but that was partly because I didn’t want it to end.

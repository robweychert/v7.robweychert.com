<cite>Computer Chess</cite> is a paradox. It appears to be a (successful) attempt to be as dry and impenetrably arcane as its subject can be, even for people who might be interested in that subject. In theory, itâ€™s a compelling experiment, but its very definition requires that it offer no rewards, and for the most part, it meets that requirement.

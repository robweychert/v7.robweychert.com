This was good for a few chuckles, but I expected more from the collective comedic pedigree involved. There are plenty of gags reminiscent of other John Landis classics like <cite>The Blues Brothers</cite> and <cite>Three Amigos</cite>, but <cite>Trading Places</cite> just doesnâ€™t have the same heart. That said, as a Philadelphia area native, I did appreciate the many location shots as a great snapshot of the city in 1983.

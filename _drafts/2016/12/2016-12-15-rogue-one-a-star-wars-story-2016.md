Stray thoughts:

• Going all in on CGI Peter Cushing was a bold move, but more than giving <cite>Rogue One</cite> a through line to <cite>A New Hope</cite>, it serves as another reminder that the uncanny valley isn’t paved over just yet.

• The introduction of moral ambiguity to the otherwise black and white Star Wars universe is not unwelcome per se, but Cassian isn’t interesting enough to give it any real weight. (Really, none of the characters demand much attention, which left me listless for much of the movie.)

• Sequels that aim to fill in as-yet-unclaimed backstory often do more harm than good, but <cite>Rogue One</cite>’s explanation of the Death Star’s vulnerability is a worthwhile resolution to one of the series’ more perplexing plot points.

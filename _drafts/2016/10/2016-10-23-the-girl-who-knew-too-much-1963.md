For the [second time](http://letterboxd.com/robweychert/film/black-sabbath/), I’ve failed to be mindful of which version of a Mario Bava film I’m watching, this time with <cite>Evil Eye</cite>, the [apparently inferior](http://letterboxd.com/screeningnotes/film/the-girl-who-knew-too-much/1/) English-language recut of <cite>The Girl Who Knew Too Much</cite>. Fool me twice, shame on me. <cite>Evil Eye</cite>’s sumptuous black and white cinematography is a joy to behold, but its murder mystery is muddled by clumsy tonal shifts and an overbearing score.

<cite>Jaws 3</cite> boasts the hokiest special effects of the entire series. Since those effects are apparently its reason for being (its original title was <cite>Jaws 3-D</cite>), and relatively little effort was exerted elsewhere in the production, this one is probably best viewed in 3-D with expectations kept low.

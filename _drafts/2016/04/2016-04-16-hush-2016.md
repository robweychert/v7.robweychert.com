In <cite>Hush</cite>, Kate Siegel gives a truly terrific performance as an isolated deaf woman targeted by a psychopath. However, said psychopath is just about the least menacing home invader to grace the silver screen since <cite>Home Alone</cite>. If you really need to see a disabled person being terrorized, your time would be better spent with [<cite>Wait Until Dark](http://letterboxd.com/film/wait-until-dark/).

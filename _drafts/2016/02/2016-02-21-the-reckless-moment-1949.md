Suggested alternate title: "<cite>The Thankless Domesticity</cite>.

Props must be given to <cite>The Reckless Moment</cite> for being one of the rare films of its era to plainly acknowledge the raw deal women get in society. Of course, the film also reinforces said raw deal by billing its chain-smoking heart and soul, Joan Bennett, beneath James Mason, who gives a weak performance to a weaker character. Along with Bennett and the cacophonous existence written for her, Burnett Guffeyâ€™s kinetic camerawork helps to elevate <cite>The Reckless Moment</cite> above your average noir, but only just barely.

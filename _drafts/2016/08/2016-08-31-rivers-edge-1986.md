A strange slice of Reagan-era, juvenile delinquent nihilism, <cite>River’s Edge</cite> feels kind of like the unholy offspring of <cite>Stand by Me</cite> and <cite>Heathers</cite>, if said offspring had caught a few scenes of <cite>Blue Velvet</cite> before his parents sent him to bed. It is less colorful and more uneven than any of those films, stymied by an ill-fitting score and an excess of melodrama. For better or worse, Crispin Glover’s wholly deranged performance, presumably green-screened in from another planet, is easily the most memorable aspect of <cite>River’s Edge</cite>. He is a puzzling but effective foil for the more sober dramatic work required of his cast mates.
